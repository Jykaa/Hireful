<h3>THE IDEA</h3>

<hr/>

<p>The idea for Hireful came to us as we thought about how we could create a project that could really benefit a lot of people in the softare industry. We took the concept that resumes are only looked at by recruiters for less then 30 seconds and decided to take this information and create something advantageous to software candidates. We compared this fact to dating sites and figured it could be beneficial to create a dating-style interfaced application that could make it simpler for applicants and employers to apply and look over resumes. From there the main concepts of Hireful were born. </p>



<h3>WHAT ARE WE?</h3>

<hr/>



<p> Hireful is an interactive platform designed to match the best candidates to their dream software jobs.  Hireful will allow you to apply to a variety of job postings related to the software field. These applications are quick and  easy and responses are received in little time. unlocking all of Hireful's benefits will allow you to apply for an infitinite number of positions at any time, you can  create and build your resumes, connect with other users and company representatives, join the VIP groups to connect and network with employers

directly and chat with other users, and expand your professional networks. At Hireful we believe that aquiring a job shouldn't be a difficult task and we are trying to make this a much simpler and enjoyable task for all software engineers/computer scientists

looking to apply.</p>



<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>

<hr/>

<p>If you are an employer offering jobs, view the employers page to get more imformation about employer memberships. If you are looking for a job, you must first sign up and choose your package. We offer memberships from bronze, silver to gold, with gold being the most highly recommended. </p>



<h3>OUR ORIGINS</h3>

<hr/>



<p>Hireful was created by a group of students at the end of 2018 for the uOttawa SEG2900 class. The project goal was to create a novel and effective start-up pitch and create a website to present in front of a panel of judges. All members of the group decided to innovate the job search industry, as it has seen few innovations and market shifts in the past decade.</p>



<h3>OUR PLATFORM</h3>

<hr/>



<p> Hireful is a cross-platform program meaning it works both on windows, mac, linux and mobile devices. Hireful is an interactive, dating style, service that is maximising interaction and prioritizing only the information that matters.</p>



<h3>VISIONS FOR THE FUTURE</h3>

<hr/>



<p> Hireful is looking to create a company that makes the hiring process more personal and engaging while streamlining it, so only the most compatible candadites and applicants meet. We look to expand our company through the rest of the job fields rather then remaining in the software field. This will be a slow process as we become more popular though soon it will be a reality</p>
