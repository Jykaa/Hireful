<h3>THE IDEA</h3>
<hr/>
<p>The idea for Hireful came to us as we thought about how we could create a project that could really benefit a lot of people in the softare industry. We took the concept that resumes are only looked at by recruiters for less then 30 seconds and decided to take this information and create something advantageous to software candidates. We compared this fact to dating sites and figured it could be beneficial to create a dating-style interfaced application that could make it simpler for applicants and employers to apply and look over resumes. From there the main concepts of Hireful were born. </p>

<h3>WHAT ARE WE?</h3>
<hr/>

<p> Hireful is an interactive platform designed to match the best candidates to their dream software jobs.  Hireful will allow you to apply to a variety of job postings related to the software field. These applications are quick and  easy and responses are received in little time. unlocking all of Hireful's benefits will allow you to apply for an infitinite number of positions at any time, you can  create and build your resumes, connect with other users and company representatives, join the VIP groups to connect and network with employers
directly and chat with other users, and expand your professional networks. At Hireful we believe that aquiring a job shouldn't be a difficult task and we are trying to make this a much simpler and enjoyable task for all software engineers/computer scientists
looking to apply.</p>

<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Hireful works as a dating-style application for employers and applicants. The user creates their personal profile and adds a unique resume that is fully annonymous from their name and photo. This unique resume allows the employer to decide upon raw talent rather then ethnicity and gender. Our algorithyms then sort through job listings in our databases that would fit the candidates skills and objectives. The user is then given a list of job listings that are the most relevant to them, they can choose to apply to any of these listings or search up listings on their own. Once applied, the employers get notified and, through a dating style interface, are presented with the applicants and their resumes (again fully annonymous of names and photos). The employer can then swipe right or left choosing if they would like to interview the candidate or not. The candidate is notified right away upon the employers action. If the employer swipes right on the candidate, the employer can then view their name and photo to better connect with the applicant. The employer can choose to send the candidate a coding challenge and simple questions to answer over the app as interview questions or pre-interview questions before determining an interview. The candidate will receive these questions and fill them out before sending it back to the employer. From there the employer can choose to hire the candidate or request an in person interview. This process can be fast and efficient and much easier for candidates and employers.  </p>

<h3>OUR ORIGINS</h3>
<hr/>

<p>Hireful was created by a group of students at the end of 2018 for the uOttawa SEG2900 class. The project goal was to create a novel and effective start-up pitch and create a website to present in front of a panel of judges. All members of the group decided to innovate the job search industry, as it has seen few innovations and market shifts in the past decade.</p>

<h3>OUR PLATFORM</h3>
<hr/>

<p> Hireful is a cross-platform program meaning it works both on windows, mac, linux and mobile devices. Hireful is an interactive, dating style, service that is maximising interaction and prioritizing only the information that matters.</p>

<h3>VISIONS FOR THE FUTURE</h3>
<hr/>

<p> We are looking to create a company that makes the hiring process more personal and engaging while streamlining it so only the most compatible candadites and applicants meet. We look to expanding our company through the rest of the job fields rather then remaining in the software field. This will be a slow process as we become more popular though soon it will be a reality</p>
